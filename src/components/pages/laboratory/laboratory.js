          A laboratory, also known as a lab, is a facility designed for
          conducting scientific experiments, research, and measurement.
          Laboratories are found in a wide variety of settings, including
          schools, universities, research institutions, companies, government
          agencies, and hospitals. They are typically equipped with specialized
          equipment and instrumentation that allows scientists to perform a wide
          range of tasks, such as:{" "}

          Laboratories play an essential role in scientific research and
          development. They provide the environment and resources that
          scientists need to make new discoveries and develop new technologies
          that improve our lives.{" "}
